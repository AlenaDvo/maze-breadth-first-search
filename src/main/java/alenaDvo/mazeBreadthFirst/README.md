# Maze 
## Create a program to find a path through a maze
### Instructions:
1. Load the maze from the standard input in the following format:
* \* wall
* \+ can be entered 
* S  starting position 
* X  goal position
2. Write the path to the standard output in the following format
  * <  go west
  * \> go east
  * v  go south
  * ^  go north
3. Detect if the solution does not exist and terminate the program.
4. Consider making the program flexible to easily switch to other input/output/error methods.
5. Try to find the shortest path algorithm.
